# HOW TO RUN
In order to compiler this software you will need the DMD compiler available from [the dlang website](https://dlang.org/dmd-windows.html "DMD Compiler"), as well as either Dub or VisualD.

**Note that in order to run the compiled application the SDL2 runtime binaries must be downloaded and placed in same directory as the executable**

## Using Dub

Dub is a command line/terminal application that can be run via `dub`. In order to compile this repository `dub build --build=release` should be ran in the root.
